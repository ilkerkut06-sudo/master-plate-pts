INSTALLATION STEPS
==================

First Time Installation:
------------------------

1. Install all prerequisites listed above
2. Start MongoDB service: net start MongoDB
3. Double-click "setup_install.bat"
4. The script will:
   - Create Python virtual environment
   - Install all dependencies
   - Setup frontend packages
   - Start backend and frontend
   - Open browser automatically

Next Time (Quick Start):
------------------------

1. Make sure MongoDB is running
2. Double-click "quick_start.bat"
3. System will start and browser will open

SYSTEM URLs
===========

Backend: http://localhost:8000
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

ADDING FIRST CAMERA
===================

1. Go to Dashboard > Cameras menu
2. Click "New Camera" button
3. Select camera type:
   - RTSP: For IP cameras (rtsp://username:password@ip:port/stream)
   - ONVIF: For ONVIF-enabled cameras
   - Webcam: For USB webcams (index: 0, 1, 2...)
4. Click "Save"
5. Return to Dashboard and start the camera

---

CHANGING OCR ENGINE
===================

1. Go to Settings menu
2. In "OCR Engine Selection" section, choose engine:
   - PaddleOCR: Fast and accurate
   - EasyOCR: Good Turkish character support
   - Tesseract: Open source
   - YOLO: Plate detection only
   - Hybrid: Best result (recommended)

---

STOPPING THE SYSTEM
===================

Close the Backend and Frontend terminal windows or press CTRL+C

---

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============

MongoDB connection error:
- Make sure MongoDB service is running: net start MongoDB
- MongoDB must run on default port (27017)

Camera won't connect:
- Verify RTSP URL is correct
- Check webcam index is correct (usually 0)
- Firewall may be blocking camera connection

OCR not working:
- At least one OCR engine must be installed (PaddleOCR and EasyOCR install automatically)
- If using Tesseract, make sure it's added to PATH
- Use "Hybrid" mode for best results

Frontend won't open:
- Port 3000 may be in use by another application
- Check terminal for error messages

Backend won't start:
- Port 8000 may be in use
- Check backend terminal for error messages
- Make sure MongoDB is running

---

TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================

Dual Pipeline Architecture:
- Pipeline A (Live): Low resolution, never freezes, WebSocket stream
- Pipeline B (OCR): High resolution, ROI + Motion Detection, plate recognition

Hybrid OCR:
All OCR engines run in parallel:
- PaddleOCR
- EasyOCR
- Tesseract
- YOLO (plate detection)

The result with highest confidence score is selected.

Optimizations:
- ROI (Region of Interest): Only plate region is processed
- Motion Detection: OCR doesn't run if no motion (saves CPU)
- WebSocket: Real-time streaming and events

---

SUPPORT
=======

If you encounter issues:
1. Check log files in logs/ folder
2. Check error messages in terminal windows
3. Verify MongoDB, Python, Node.js versions
